Automate making a sampled instrument for Decent Sampler in Processing.

This sketch controls an external synth or keyboard via MIDI to make it play a series of notes, and then records each note into a separate .wav file, suitable for loading into a sampling instrument in Decent Sampler or equivalent.

It also creates a Decent Sampler .dspreset file.
